# InstantDEX-Sleuther

Dependencies:

- Python 2.x
- Python-Bitcoinrpc (pip install python-bitcoinrpc)
- SuperNET/NXT/BTCD (https://github.com/jl777/btcd)

assetInfo.txt contains names/assetIDs/descriptions for all assets. Used to allow asset names to be entered instead of IDs
Remember to modify sleuther.conf to match your BitcoinDark.conf settings
Heavy use of sys specific commands like system('clear') vs system('cls') for now
