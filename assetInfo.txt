In today’s world new businesses pop up all the time. Every second of every minute of every hour of every day: a new business starts it's journey. Some are good and some are bad, some fail and some succeed, but they all have one thing in common: they all need a domain name. Domains were the first assets of the internet, and with the ever rapid and enormous growth of both cryptocurrencies and the domain market, it is almost poetically natural for the two to be joined together.
